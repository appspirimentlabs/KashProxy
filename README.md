KashProxy is born from a thought to have the Charles Proxy within the application to make life of developers and testers the testing easier.

KashProxy simplifies the process of mocking of **HTTP(S) requests/responses** fired by your Android App. KashProxy works as an **OkHttp Interceptor**, and will provide the required response for the URLs you configured in the KashProxy Mapping List. It provides the required UI for create mapping for each API URL.

KashProxy also integrate the famous Network Monitoring library [Chucker](https://github.com/ChuckerTeam/chucker) in it, in order to make the mapping of URL more easier and effortless. The app will bring all the features of [Chucker](https://github.com/ChuckerTeam/chucker) too, providing easy extension functions to set up [Chucker](https://github.com/ChuckerTeam/chucker) and KashProxy.

Apps using KashProxy will display a **notification** showing a summary of ongoing HTTP response mappings. Tapping on the notification launches the full KashProxy UI. Apps can optionally suppress the notification, and launch the KashProxy UI and [Chucker](https://github.com/ChuckerTeam/chucker) directly from within their own interface.
